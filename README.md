# Titanic Insurance Company üõ•Ô∏è

The objective of this project is to predict rent prices in S√£o Paulo City, with data acquired in April 2019  
Three ML models were used: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest  
With this project, it was clear to see how ML could overfit, reaching unexpected results even with good rmse  
In the end, I tried to optimize the best model parameters and created a graph to visualize better when the prediction is better
